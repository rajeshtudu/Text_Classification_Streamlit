Terence Crawford dismantled Errol Spence Jr to become the four-belt era's first undisputed welterweight champion.

The WBO champion, 35, knocked Spence down three times before the referee ended the punishment in the ninth.

The win makes him the first man to win undisputed titles in two weight classes as he stripped his domestic rival of his WBC, WBA (Super) and IBF titles.

Spence, 31, was undefeated in 28 fights and the Las Vegas showdown was his eighth world title bout in a row.

But Crawford, in his 18th consecutive championship bout, staked a firm claim as the world's best boxer as he extended his win streak to 40 fights at T-Mobile Arena.

"I'm an overachiever, nobody believed in me when I was coming up," Crawford said.

"It means everything because of who I took the belts from. They talk bad about me and I kept praying to God I would get the opportunity to show the world how great I am.

"And tonight, I believe I showed how great I am."

Spence has the option to activate an immediate rematch and Crawford said he was open to agreeing a second fight.

"Of course the public will buy it," he said.

"If the fight happens again, I'm pretty everyone will come out and show support for us."
